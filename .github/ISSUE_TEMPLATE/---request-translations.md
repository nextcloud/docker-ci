# üë§ App repository

**To be done by you**

- [ ] Link to your repository: 
- [ ] If the app is not in the Nextcloud organisation
    - [ ] Invite `nextcloud-bot` with write permissions
    - [ ] Make sure all translated branches do **not** have branch protection enabled, see https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/developer_manual/basics/front-end/l10n.html#setup-of-the-transifex-sync for more details
- [ ] Create file `l10n/.gitkeep` with empty content
- [ ] Add `.l10nignore` to exclude compiled JS files and thirdparty code, e.g. ignoring compiled javascript assets and composer PHP dependencies in the vendor/ directory:
  ```
  js/
  vendor/
  ```
- [ ] Create file `.tx/config` with the following content, replace `{{APPID}}` with your app id 3 times:
  ```ini
  [main]
  host     = https://www.transifex.com
  lang_map = hu_HU: hu, nb_NO: nb, sk_SK: sk, th_TH: th, ja_JP: ja, bg_BG: bg, cs_CZ: cs, fi_FI: fi

  [o:nextcloud:p:nextcloud:r:{{APPID}}]
  file_filter = translationfiles/<lang>/{{APPID}}.po
  source_file = translationfiles/templates/{{APPID}}.pot
  source_lang = en
  type        = PO
  ```
- [ ] ‚öôÔ∏è Validate your repository and translation strings:
  ```sh
  bash translations/validateSyncSetup.sh Owner Repository
  ```
